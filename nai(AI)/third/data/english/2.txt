Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022.[27] Internationally considered an act of aggression,[28][29][30] the invasion has triggered Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II,[31][32] with more than 4.1 million Ukrainians leaving the country[33] and a quarter of the population displaced.[34][35]

The invasion marked a major escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War, which began following the 2014 Ukrainian Revolution of Dignity. Russia subsequently annexed Crimea, and Russian-backed separatists seized part of the south-eastern Donbas region of Ukraine, sparking a war there.[36][37] In 2021, Russia began a large military build-up along its border with Ukraine, amassing up to 190,000 troops along with their equipment. In a broadcast shortly before the invasion, Russian president Vladimir Putin espoused irredentist views,[38] questioned Ukraine's right to statehood,[39][40] and falsely accused Ukraine of being dominated by neo-Nazis who persecute the Russian-speaking, ethnic Russian minority.[41] Putin said that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), by expanding eastward since the early 2000s, had threatened Russia's security – a claim disputed by NATO[42] – and demanded Ukraine be barred from ever joining the alliance.[43] The United States and others accused Russia of planning to attack or invade Ukraine, which Russian officials repeatedly denied as late as 23 February 2022.[47]
