On 21 February 2022, Russia recognised the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic, two self-proclaimed statelets in Donbas controlled by pro-Russian separatists.[48] The following day, the Federation Council of Russia authorised the use of military force abroad, and overt Russian troops entered both territories.[49] The invasion began on the morning of 24 February,[50] when Putin announced a "special military operation" to "demilitarise and denazify" Ukraine.[51][52] Minutes later, missiles and airstrikes struck throughout Ukraine, including the capital Kyiv, shortly followed by a large ground invasion from multiple directions.[53][54] In response, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy enacted martial law and general mobilisation.[55][56]

Multi-pronged offensives were launched from Russia, Belarus, and the two occupied territories of Ukraine (Crimea and Donbas). The four major offensives are the Kyiv offensive, the Northeastern Ukraine offensive, the Eastern Ukraine offensive, and the Southern Ukraine offensive. Russian aircraft and missiles also struck western parts of Ukraine. Russian forces have approached or besieged key settlements, including Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mariupol, and Sumy,[57] but met stiff Ukrainian resistance and experienced logistical and operational challenges that hampered their progress.[58][59] Three weeks after launching the invasion, the Russian military had more success in the south, while incremental gains or stalemates elsewhere forced them into attrition warfare, resulting in mounting civilian casualties.[60]
