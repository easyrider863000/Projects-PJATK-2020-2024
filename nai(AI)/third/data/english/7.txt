In 2009, Yanukovych announced his intent to again run for president in the 2010 Ukrainian presidential election,[83] which he subsequently won.[84] In November 2013, a wave of large, pro-EU protests erupted in response to Yanukovych's sudden decision not to sign the EUâ€“Ukraine Association Agreement, instead choosing closer ties to Russia and the Eurasian Economic Union. The Verkhovna Rada had overwhelmingly supported the agreement with the EU.[85] Russia had put pressure on Ukraine to reject it.[86]

The scope of the protests widened, with protesters opposing widespread government corruption, police brutality, and repressive anti-protest laws.[87] In February 2014, clashes in Kyiv between protesters and Berkut special police resulted in the deaths of 100 protesters and 13 policemen; most of the victims were shot by police snipers.[88] On 21 February 2014, Yanukovych and parliamentary opposition leaders signed an agreement calling for an interim government and early elections. The following day, Yanukovych fled Kyiv and later Ukraine;[89] the Ukrainian parliament subsequently voted to remove him from office.[90][91][92] Leaders in Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine declared continuing loyalty to Yanukovych,[93] leading to pro-Russian unrest.[94] Russian state-controlled media portrayed the crisis as having been instigated by the post-Yanukovych Ukrainian government, and represented Euromaidan as being controlled by "ultranationalist", "fascist",[95][96] "neo-Nazi",[97] and "anti-Semitic" groups.[98]
